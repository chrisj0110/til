I'm starting to use lazyvim. Here is my conversion cheatsheet:

## Updated Keymaps

`<leader>re` => `<leader>/` to grep from root dir
`ctrl-p` => `<leader>ff` to fzf files from root of current file, or `<leader>fF` from the original root
`<leader> tr` => `<leader>fb` fzf buffers
`<c-j>` => `<c-n>` to move down autocomplete list, etc
`<c-y>` => `<cr>` to select from autocomplete
`<c-l>` => `tab` to navigate through snippet sections
`<leader>tk` => `<leader>sk` to search keymaps
`<leader>gb` => `<leader>gC` to view changes in current branch

## New Keymaps

`<leader>st` to fzf TODOs
`<leader>gg` for lazygit, or `<leader>gG` to open the original root's repo
`:Noice` to view recent messages
